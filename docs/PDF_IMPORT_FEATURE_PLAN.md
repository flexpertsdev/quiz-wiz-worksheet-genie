## Feature Components

### 1. PDF Upload Component
```typescript
interface PDFUploadProps {
  onUpload: (files: File[]) => void
  maxFiles?: number
  maxSizePerFile?: number // in MB
  acceptedFormats?: string[]
}
```

### 2. PDF Viewer Component
```typescript
interface PDFViewerProps {
  file: File | string // File object or URL
  highlightRegions?: Region[]
  onRegionClick?: (region: Region) => void
  currentPage?: number
  zoom?: number
}
```

### 3. Question Extraction Panel
```typescript
interface ExtractionPanelProps {
  extractedQuestions: ExtractedQuestion[]
  onEdit: (question: ExtractedQuestion) => void
  onDelete: (questionId: string) => void
  onTypeChange: (questionId: string, type: QuestionType) => void
  onBatchAction: (action: BatchAction) => void
}
```

### 4. Question Editor Modal
```typescript
interface QuestionEditorProps {
  question: ExtractedQuestion
  pdfContext?: PDFContext // Show source PDF section
  onSave: (question: Question) => void
  onCancel: () => void
}
```
